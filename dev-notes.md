# Nest Extension Development Notes

## ðŸš¨ RECENT BUG FIXES (December 2024) - 9 Critical Issues Resolved âœ…

### Major Issues Resolution - All Fixed!

#### 1. âœ… FIXED: New Tab Window ID Error (Edge Compatibility) + Restricted Context Detection
- **Problem**: "Uncaught (in promise) Error: No window with id: -2" when users disable Nest new tab page in browser settings
- **Root Cause**: Using `chrome.windows.WINDOW_ID_CURRENT` constant (-2) without proper window resolution when extension context is limited
- **Enhanced Solution**: 
  - **Context Detection**: Added `checkExtensionContext()` function to detect when APIs are restricted
  - **API Validation**: Check if `chrome.windows`, `chrome.sidePanel`, and `chrome.storage` are available and functional
  - **Window ID Validation**: Verify that `chrome.windows.getCurrent()` returns valid window ID (> 0)
  - **Graceful Degradation**: Show appropriate UI and user-friendly messages when APIs are unavailable
  - **Visual Indicators**: Added yellow banner at top of page when in restricted mode
  - **Fallback Messaging**: Comprehensive error handling with background script fallback
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `src/newtab/NewTab.tsx` - Added context detection and improved error handling
  - `src/newtab/newtab.css` - Added restricted context banner styling
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - **Context Check**: `if (!chrome?.windows || !chrome?.sidePanel || !chrome?.storage)` detection
  - **Window Validation**: `windows.id === undefined || windows.id < 0` check
  - **User Feedback**: Alert messages directing users to extension toolbar icon
  - **Disabled States**: Buttons and functions disabled when in restricted context
  - **Visual Banner**: `restricted-context-banner` with AlertTriangle icon and explanation
- **Result**: âœ… Extension gracefully handles browser new tab override being disabled with clear user guidance and no errors

#### 2. âœ… FIXED: Dropdown Menu Positioning Issue
- **Problem**: Dropdown menus getting cut off at bottom of sidebar
- **Root Cause**: CSS `position: fixed` causing dropdowns to position relative to viewport instead of parent container
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated CSS positioning from `position: fixed` to `position: absolute`
  - Added smart positioning classes `.position-up` and `.position-left`
  - Implemented dynamic positioning logic based on viewport space
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `src/sidepanel/sidepanel.css` - Updated dropdown positioning CSS
  - `src/sidepanel/components/InboxCard.tsx` - Added positioning state management
  - `src/sidepanel/components/LinkCard.tsx` - Added positioning state management
- **Result**: âœ… Dropdown menus now intelligently position themselves to stay within viewport

#### 3. âœ… COMPLETED: Floating AI Window Documentation
- **Problem**: Missing comprehensive documentation for floating AI assistant feature
- **Solution**: Added detailed documentation covering all aspects of the feature
- **Documentation Added**:
  - Feature overview and capabilities
  - Activation methods (keyboard, UI buttons, command palette)
  - Quick action prompts (Summarize, Explain, Key Points, etc.)
  - Technical implementation details
  - User experience features and design decisions
- **Files Modified**: `dev-notes.md` - Added complete floating AI assistant section
- **Result**: âœ… Complete feature documentation for development team and user reference

#### 4. âœ… FIXED: Legacy Terminology Cleanup  
- **Problem**: Remaining backend references to "Holding Area" instead of "Uncategorized Links"
- **Root Cause**: UI was updated but variable names in code still used old terminology
- **Solution**:
  - Renamed `holdingAreaLinks` variable to `uncategorizedLinks` in main component
  - Updated all references to use new variable name
  - Changed comments from "Holding Area" to "Uncategorized Links"
- **Files Modified**: `src/sidepanel/Sidepanel.tsx` - Variable and comment updates
- **Result**: âœ… Consistent terminology throughout UI and backend code

#### 5. âœ… COMPLETED: Comprehensive README.md

# Development Notes

## Bug Fixes

### Fixed Dropdown Positioning Logic (2024-12-19)

**Issue:** The dropdown menu's horizontal positioning logic was flawed in both `LinkCard.tsx` and `InboxCard.tsx`. The `shouldPositionLeft` condition incorrectly checked if the button was near the left edge (`buttonRect.right < 200`) instead of detecting if the right-aligned dropdown would overflow the right edge of the viewport.

**Solution:** 
- Updated positioning logic to check `buttonRect.right + dropdownWidth > window.innerWidth`
- Added proper dropdown width calculation (200px approximation)
- This ensures dropdowns position correctly to avoid off-screen display

**Files Changed:**
- `src/sidepanel/components/InboxCard.tsx` - Line 95
- `src/sidepanel/components/LinkCard.tsx` - Line 182

### Fixed TagInput Component Interface (2024-12-19)

**Issue:** `InboxCard.tsx` was using incorrect props for the `TagInput` component, causing TypeScript linter errors. The component was passing `linkId`, `onTagsUpdated`, and `onCancel` props, but the actual interface expects `selectedTags`, `availableTags`, and `onTagsChange`.

**Solution:**
- Added proper state management (`linkTags`, `availableTags`, `loadingTags`)
- Implemented `loadTags()` and `handleTagsChange()` functions similar to `LinkCard.tsx`
- Updated TagInput usage to match the correct interface
- Added proper loading state and header UI for tag editing

**Files Changed:**
- `src/sidepanel/components/InboxCard.tsx` - Added state management and corrected TagInput props

Both fixes ensure consistent dropdown positioning behavior and proper tag management functionality across the application.
