This guide will help you set up a new Supabase project with all the required database tables, policies, and configurations for the Nest Chrome extension and web dashboard.

## üìã Prerequisites

- A Supabase account ([sign up here](https://supabase.com))

   - **Name**: `nest-knowledge-app` (or your preferred name)
   - **Database Password**: Generate a strong password (save this!)
   - **Region**: Choose closest to your location
5. Click "Create new project"
6. Wait for project initialization (2-3 minutes)

### 2. Run Database Setup SQL

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
2. Click **"New Query"**
3. Copy the entire content from `supabase-setup.sql` file
4. Paste it into the SQL editor
5. Click **"Run"** (or press Ctrl/Cmd + Enter)
6. Verify success - you should see confirmation messages and verification results

### 3. Get Your Project Credentials

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **API** in your Supabase dashboard
2. Copy the following values:
   - **Project URL** (e.g., `https://your-project-id.supabase.co`)
   - **Anon (public) Key** (starts with `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`)

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the `packages/web-dashboard/` directory:

```bash
cd packages/web-dashboard
cp .env.local.template .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` with your Supabase credentials:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...

# Environment
NODE_ENV=development
```

### 5. Test the Setup

Start the web dashboard:

```bash
yarn dev:web
```

1. Open http://localhost:3000
